# HTML Basics - The Odin Project

This directory contains all the files and projects related to the HTML Basics module of The Odin Project. Below is a summary of the key concepts covered in this module:

## 1. **Introduction to HTML and CSS**
   - **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the backbone of any website. It provides the structure and content, while **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is used to style and layout the webpage.

## 2. **Elements and Tags**
   - HTML is made up of elements that define the structure of the page.
   - Tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, and others define content and attributes.

## 3. **HTML Boilerplate**
   - Every HTML file starts with a boilerplate, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
   - Essential metadata and linked files (like CSS) are placed inside the `<head>`.

## 4. **Working with Text**
   - Learn to format text using tags like `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, and `<p>` for paragraphs.
   - Use `<strong>` and `<em>` to emphasize text.

## 5. **Lists**
   - HTML supports ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists, with `<li>` for each list item.

## 6. **Links and Images**
   - **Links**: Use the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute to create hyperlinks.
   - **Images**: The `<img>` tag is used to embed images, requiring the `src` attribute to specify the image source and `alt` for accessibility.

## 7. **Project: Recipes**
   - This project applies the basics of HTML to create a simple recipe webpage, demonstrating how to use links, images, and structured content.
